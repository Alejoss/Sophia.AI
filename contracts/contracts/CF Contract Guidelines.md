Detailed Step-by-Step Flow

    User:
        Sends a URL to the ChainlinkFunctionsInteraction contract via a transaction.

    ChainlinkFunctionsInteraction Contract:
        Receives the URL and creates a Chainlink request.
        Forwards the request to Chainlink Functions.

    Chainlink Functions:
        Executes the following Deno script:
            Scraping: Scrapes the website using the provided URL to extract the text.
            GPTZero Verification: Sends the extracted text to GPTZero via an API call to determine if it is AI-generated.
            Verification Response: If GPTZero confirms the text is not AI-generated:
                IPFS Storage: Uploads the text to IPFS and gets the IPFS CID.
                SHA-256 Hashing: Computes the SHA-256 hash of the text.
            Returns both the SHA-256 hash and IPFS CID to the ChainlinkFunctionsInteraction contract.

    ChainlinkFunctionsInteraction Contract:
        Receives the SHA-256 hash and IPFS CID from Chainlink Functions.
        Forwards the SHA-256 hash, IPFS CID, and the user's address to the StoreHashContract.

    StoreHashContract:
        Receives the SHA-256 hash, IPFS CID, and the user's address.
        Stores the SHA-256 hash in a mapping.
        Associates the SHA-256 hash with the IPFS CID and the user's address.
        Adds the SHA-256 hash to a list of hashes associated with the user.
        Emits an event with the hash and user information.
        Transfers ERC20 tokens as a reward to the user.


Explanation of the Code

    Imports and Interface:
        Import necessary contracts from OpenZeppelin and Chainlink.
        Define an interface IStoreHashContract to interact with the StoreHashContract.

    State Variables:
        oracle: Address of the Chainlink oracle.
        jobId: Job ID for the specific task (scraping, AI verification, and IPFS storage).
        fee: Fee for the Chainlink request.
        storeHashContract: Address of the StoreHashContract.

    Constructor:
        Initializes the contract with the oracle address, job ID, fee, LINK token address, and StoreHashContract address.
        Sets the LINK token for Chainlink interactions using setChainlinkToken.

    requestHash Function:
        Builds a Chainlink request with the specified URL.
        Sends the request to the Chainlink oracle.
        Returns the request ID.

    fulfill Function:
        Called by Chainlink when the request is fulfilled.
        Emits an event RequestFulfilled with the request ID, SHA-256 hash, and IPFS CID.
        Calls the storeHash function of the StoreHashContract to store the hash and IPFS CID along with the userâ€™s address.
